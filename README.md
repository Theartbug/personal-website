Objective
===

Create a personal website that demonstrates my design and application capabilities. Keep it brief and sleek.
Use:
  - React
  - Webpack
  - Netlify for hosting
  - CSS with pre / post processors
  - Intersection observer API
  - Github API
  - Responsive image loading
  - Mobile first / responsive design
  - Jest to test

Steps Taken
===

Research other personal websites that I find well done. Take parts from those and implement my own versions of them, such as grey / dark grey / white backgrounds to denote sections, buttons with auto-scroll, a jumbo image of myself.

Research and implement Github API so the number of applications I have created will automatically update. Test functions created using Jest. Create a cache in local storage to store results since it takes ~10 seconds to retrieve all of the data. Check the cache date when a user visits the page; if it is over a month old, refresh the data.

Research and implement IntersectionObserver API so I can keep track of what section the user is viewing; the auto-scroll buttons will update to match. Also works with page refresh!
